Notes:

1. Always try to go second
2. Against yellow, need to starve them a little bit early if we go first. Start swinging when we can clear next turn with Nusjuro/Mars. That means start swinging on turn 4, 5. Don't swing turn 3
3. If you have a nusjuro + leader swing into a char that is smaller than leader, it is better to swing even insteasd of 1 big 1 small. It's because they will counter out the small one and take the big one
   Matchups specifics

4. Mihawks
   a. Their curve would be Tashigi, Shanks, Shanks, LP, LP
   b. Our curve going first:
   . Search
   . Search + Swing 5 (Doesn't matter since he take anyway)
   . (Search), Saturn + Swing 5 or 6 (Usually they will take here)
   . Jupiter + Swing 7 and 7 leave 2 dons for defensive. Or Jupiter + Warcury/Saturn. Or mars if they don't have tashigi/Perona
   . Nusjuro + 4 and swing bunch of 6s and leave dons to defend. Or Nus + swing 7 8. That would make their hand size pretty low
   . Chain 5 elders. Try going for game in the second one since we are on a timer

5. Gecko
   a. If they don't have any trash, you can swing 5 (not 6) to either bait a card or them risking not getting a good trigger
   b. Prioritize clearing board first to have control, then at some point when you are healthy enough, ignore the board and try going for game
